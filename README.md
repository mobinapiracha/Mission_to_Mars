# Mission to Mars
The purpose of this project is to scrape some interesting information about Mars from several different sources by scraping this information from the web and presenting this information in a flask application. In order to do this we use HTML, CSS and Python. We use Python's beautifulsoup and splinter package in Jupyter Notebooks in order to scrape data from the web, then we add this information into our python script which contains our scraping function, and lastly we present this scraped data using a flask application in app.py. Therefore, we are able to create a web application that activately scrapes the latest mars news from the NASA website, as well as the latest Mars images, shows a table comparing Mars and Earth, and displays mars images.
